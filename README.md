# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description
A work day planner with normal buisness hours of opperation times (9AM to 5PM) are displayed on a scrollable screen. Next to each time there is a text box with the ability to enter text that can be save to the users local storage with a save button. Once the text has been saved it can then be recalled automatically when the page is reloaded. At the top of the screen the current date and time are displayed and will automatically update every second. If the current time has passed any of the displayed times on the left that text will change color to gray. The current hour will be displayed in red and any future hours will be in green.
